Bank Note Authentication Problem:

https://github.com/krishnaik06/FastAPI

To Understand FastAPI, i have downloaded already built project folder from Krish naik Github
So actual python code is MOdelTraining.ipynb. I have already created classifier.pkl file, app.py , requirement.txt , (templates, static not req)
Just i did deployment by syncing this in my github

Approach:

By using Linear RandomForset Regressor , we are predicting the JBank Note Authentication based on user input data as 0 or 1
Here we have 4 input value: variance,skewness,curtosis,entropy output class 0 or 1

> 0 means real note, 1 is fake note

Here we used FastAPI web application Framework and deployed in Heroku(PlatformAs A service-PAAS) using gIThUB.


Here main files are :
		app.py
		model.pkl
		requirements.txt
		Procfile
		Banknotes.py  (This is user defined file. inside we used library - pydantic base model to build the BankNote CLASS
				 to post column name in web)
